In NEXTJS 13, the project directory structure comprises two main folders:

1. Public Folder:
In the context of Next.js, the "public" folder plays a role in serving static assets, such as images. These assets are accessible through a URL that originates from the root directory. By placing files within the "public" folder, you establish a base URL (/) reference point for your code to access these resources.

2. SRC Folder:
The "src" folder assumes a central role within the application's architecture. This directory houses the entire application logic and components. Notably, the "app" subfolder within "src" contains the core components of the application.

This structured approach provides a clear separation of static assets from the dynamic application code, enhancing organization and maintainability.
